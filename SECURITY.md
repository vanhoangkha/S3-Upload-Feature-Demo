## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Create a Public Issue

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to the maintainers with the following information:

- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability`
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity and severity

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Code Security
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or other secrets
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user-generated content
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization

#### Infrastructure Security
- **IAM Policies**: Follow principle of least privilege
- **Encryption**: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit
- **Network Security**: Implement proper network segmentation
- **Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging
- **Updates**: Keep dependencies and infrastructure updated

### For Users

#### Deployment Security
- **Environment Variables**: Use secure methods to manage secrets
- **AWS Credentials**: Use IAM roles instead of access keys when possible
- **Network Access**: Restrict network access to necessary ports and IPs
- **Monitoring**: Enable CloudTrail and CloudWatch monitoring
- **Backup**: Implement secure backup strategies

#### Operational Security
- **Access Control**: Implement proper RBAC policies
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits
- **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan
- **Training**: Ensure team members are trained on security best practices

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **AWS Cognito**: Secure user authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with proper expiration
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- **MFA Support**: Multi-factor authentication capability

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: KMS encryption for DynamoDB and S3
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Data Classification**: Proper handling of sensitive data
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails

### Infrastructure Security
- **VPC**: Network isolation and security groups
- **IAM**: Least-privilege access policies
- **CloudTrail**: API call logging and monitoring
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall protection (when applicable)

## Security Scanning

### Automated Security Checks

We use the following tools for automated security scanning:

- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security scanning
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint Security**: JavaScript/TypeScript security linting
- **Terraform Security**: Infrastructure security validation

### Manual Security Reviews

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Architecture Reviews**: Security assessment of design changes
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing (recommended)
- **Dependency Audits**: Regular review of third-party dependencies

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates on the status of reported vulnerabilities
- We will credit researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the vulnerability before public disclosure
- Do not access, modify, or delete data that doesn't belong to you
- Do not perform actions that could harm the availability or integrity of our services
- Do not use social engineering, physical attacks, or attacks against our employees

## Security Contacts

For security-related inquiries:

- **Security Issues**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub
- **General Security Questions**: Use GitHub Discussions with the "security" label
- **Urgent Security Matters**: Contact maintainers directly through GitHub
